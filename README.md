Hearing-impaired people encounter significant mobility issues in their everyday life as the desire to communicate what they think and need in an increasingly crowded urban society grows, all for social, physiological, safety, and self-esteem reasons.

<b>Talk Through Me</b> is an Android application that provides a speaking assistant for the hearing impaired individuals.

The applcation uses integrated python scripts as tools for loading a <i>machine learning</i> model and creating predictions and inferences with it. <a href="https://chaquo.com/"><b>Chaquopy</b></a> was the Python SDK for Android which enabled this.

The application uses <a href="https://github.com/ming024/FastSpeech2"><b>FastSpeech 2</b></a> as a main text-to-speech engine.
